## Python Decorator

### Purpose

A Python decorator that takes whatever the decorated function returns, and writes it to a file in a new line. 

For this problem, it is assumed the decorated functions always return a string.

The decorator is called log_message and writes to the file /tmp/decorator_logs.txt.
